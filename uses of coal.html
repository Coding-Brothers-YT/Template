        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-2" align="justify" style="text-justify:inter-word;">
         Coal is primarily used as a fuel. While coal has been known and used for thousands of years, its usage was limited prior to the Industrial Revolution. With the invention of the steam engine coal consumption increased. As of 2016, coal remains an important fuel as it supplied about a quarter of the world's primary energy and two-fifths of electricity. Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal. <br>
         <ol>
         <li><br>Steam coal - also known as thermal coal - is mainly used in power generation.</li>
         <li>Coking coal - also known as metallurgical coal - is mainly used in steel production.</li><br>
         Other important users of coal include alumina refineries, paper manufacturers, and the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Several chemical products can be produced from the by-products of coal. Refined coal tar is used in the manufacture of chemicals, such as creosote oil, naphthalene, phenol, and benzene. Ammonia gas recovered from coke ovens is used to manufacture ammonia salts, nitric acid and agricultural fertilisers. Thousands of different products have coal or coal by-products as components: soap, aspirins, solvents, dyes, plastics and fibres, such as rayon and nylon.<br>
         Coal is also an essential ingredient in the production of specialist products:<br>
         <ol>
         <li><br>Activated carbon - used in filters for water and air purification and in kidney dialysis machines.</li>
         <li>Carbon fibre - an extremely strong but light weight reinforcement material used in construction, mountain bikes and tennis rackets.
         <li>Silicon metal - used to produce silicones and silanes, which are in turn used to make lubricants, water repellents, resins, cosmetics, hair shampoos and toothpastes.</li><br>

         Coal plays a vital role in electricity generation worldwide. Coal-fuelled power plants currently fuel 38% of global electricity and, in some countries, coal fuels a higher percentage of electricity.<br>
         Steel is an alloy based primarily on iron. As iron occurs only as iron oxides in the earth’s crust, the ores must be converted, or ‘reduced’, using carbon. The primary source of this carbon is coking coal.<br>
         Coal is used as an energy source in cement production. Large amounts of energy are required to produce cement. It takes about 200 kg of coal to produce one tonne of cement and about 300-400 kg of cement is needed to produce one cubic metre of concrete.<br>
         Liquid fuels from coal can provide a viable alternative to conventional oil products and can be used in the existing supply infrastructure. Several coal-to-liquids (CTL) demonstration plants are being developed in China, whilst in South Africa liquid fuels derived from coal provide 30% of South Africa's transport fuel requirements  and CTL plants produce more than 160,000 barrels of liquid fuel per day from coal.<br>
